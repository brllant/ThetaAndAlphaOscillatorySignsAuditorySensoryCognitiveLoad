# Theta and Alpha Oscillatory Signatures of Auditory Sensory- and Cognitive Loads During Complex Listening
MATLAB codes for the manuscript **"Theta and alpha oscillatory signatures of auditory sensory and cognitive loads during complex listening".**

Goal of the study was to identify osicllatory activities as objective markers (or signatures) of sensory- and cognitive loads during challening listening.

EEG-raw data was collected from Normal-Hearing Young Adult Listeners in Tel Aviv University. <br />
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ethics as Tel Aviv University.

Upon analysis, the data was first converted using Brainstorm (https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/) <br />

The further analysis were then done using Matlab and Fieldtrip Toolbox (https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) <br />
